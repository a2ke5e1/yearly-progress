## What you can contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- UI/UX improvements
- Translations and localization

Before starting work on larger changes or new features, it is recommended to
open an issue to discuss the idea.

## Translation contributions

Translations are handled using Android string resources (`strings.xml`).

Please read the full translation guide before starting:  
https://github.com/a2ke5e1/yearly-progress/blob/main/TRANSLATIONS.md

Guidelines for translations:
- One language per Pull Request
- Do not change string keys
- Do not remove existing strings
- Preserve placeholders and formatting
- Ensure XML files are valid

---

## Feature and code contributions

For new features or code changes:

- Follow existing project structure and architecture
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same Pull Request
- Ensure the app builds and runs correctly
- Follow Android and Kotlin best practices

For significant changes, please open an issue first to align on direction.

---

## Pull Request guidelines

- Clearly describe what the Pull Request does
- Reference related issues if applicable
- Keep commits clean and meaningful
- One feature or fix per Pull Request
- Ensure the project builds successfully

Pull Requests that break builds, introduce regressions, or modify translation keys
without reason may be rejected.
